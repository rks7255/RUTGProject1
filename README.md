#Limitations in Analysis
We just had access to foreclosure filings or notices data, however if we were able to track foreclosure filings from initiation to resolution that would allows us to better understand how foreclosures resulting in different outcomes affect crime. 
We could have find out if impacts on crime vary depending on the outcomes of the foreclosures.
